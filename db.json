          "HashSet<String> words = new HashSet<String>();",
          "HashSet words = new HashSet<String>();",

        "correctChoice": 0,
        "explanation": "HashSet must include type parameters, and the correct syntax includes the use of generics <String>."

        "id": 2,
        "type": "narrative",
        "prompt": "Explain the concept of method overloading in Java.",
        "correctAnswer": "Method overloading is when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but differ in their parameter types or number of parameters. Java uses this to create more readable and flexible code.",
        "explanation": "Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods having the same name, if their parameter lists are different."

        "prompt": "Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript.",
